bio: |
  Software Engineer specialized in the Android/Linux stack. I’m affectionate for tracking issues across
  system layers and crafting pragmatic solutions—from Kotlin app code down to native components.
  I focus on reliable, maintainable software: performance profiling, crash/ANR reduction, build systems,
  and developer experience. Currently based in Toronto, Canada.
